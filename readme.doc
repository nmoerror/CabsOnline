The system is separated so you'll have to change between Booking.html and Admin.html manually. 

On Admin.html you have to refresh (after booking) and you'll see the bookings in the last 2 hours that don't have a taxi. 

When you copy the reference number and search for it, you can assign a taxi to that reference number booking. 

NOTE: RED = Unassined,  GREEN = Assigned.
